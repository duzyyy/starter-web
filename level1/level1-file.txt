Here’s the Aussie wrap from Day 2!




AUSSIE MEDALLIST’S LATE WITHDRAWAL

Australian race-walker Dane Bird-Smith has withdrawn from the Games due to family medical reasons.


Bird-Smith claimed bronze in the 20km Race Walk at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and had been in Cairns with a group of Australian athletes preparing to head to Tokyo, only to withdraw on Sunday night.

“Unfortunately, there have been twists and turns over the last year that all Olympians have had to face. For me that includes family health challenges that have become a priority,” he said in a statement.

“Couple these challenges with difficult travel restrictions around the COVID pandemic, I have made the decision to stay in Australia with my family and withdraw myself from the Australian Olympic Team for Tokyo.

“This is a tough decision as an athlete, but it is a decision that will see my desire to compete and win for Australia strongly continue next year and onwards.
